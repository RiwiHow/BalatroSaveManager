# BalatroSaveManager
A simple tool to manager Balatro saves.

## Usage
- Press `[` to copy saves
- Press `â†‘` to select a save and press `Enter` to load selected save
- To automatically load selected save, use [BalatroQuickLoad](https://github.com/TsunamiinFantasy/BalatroQuickLoad).

## Known Issues and Workarounds
- The screenshot feature is only for Windows. However, it may have issues that prevent it from capturing the real-time screen in some cases. If you encounter this problem, you can change Balatro's `Windows Mode` to `Windowed` in `OPTIONS -> Settings -> Video`.
